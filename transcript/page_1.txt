I am a PASS tutor. On Wednesday I will host a PASS session to help students with their homework.

But I don't know which part I can help to improve their academic performance... Hmm, I want to have some materials to figure out what I can help

Click a link to the resource centre, so I can access the teaching lecture notes and slide

I also found the grading statistics that help identify where most students have difficulties with their studies

So I can easily prepare materials with solution to targeted problems for students

The session turns out a great success!
