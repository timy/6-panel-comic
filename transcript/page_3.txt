I am interested in supporting students with my experience, so I become a PASS tutor

But a PASS tutor is not a full-time job. I have my own work to do. It is not easy to determine when I have time to attend the session for the next semester

The good thing is I am allowed to register my interest for different time intervals.

The system collects the preference of all registered tutors and helps the coordinator to schedule sessions

Once submitted, I only need to wait for notification from the system

I am happy with the allocation since the scheduled session does not conflict with my other daily schedules.
