I am interested in supporting students with my experience, so I try to register as a PASS tutor

There is some prerequisite to become a PASS tutor. I need to provide evidence to show I am a qualified tutor

It really takes time to prepare the document, like my GPA, graduation parchment...

Fortunately, I don't need to print out all documents and send it in person. I only need to type in my student ID, the system will automatically fill the information

After clicking "submit", I just need to wait for the review decision from the school committee.

It is easier to become a tutor with the online system!
